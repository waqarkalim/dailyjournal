What it does
Our product provides a user-friendly platform for logging and recording journal entries and incorporates natural language processing (NLP) to conduct sentiment analysis. Users will be able to see generated insights from their journal entries, such as how their sentiments have changed over time.

How we built it
Our front-end is powered by the ReactJS library, while our backend is powered by ExpressJS. Our sentiment analyzer was integrated with our NodeJS backend, which is also connected to a MySQL database.
